# Pop Culture

The mod to end all mods, Pop Culture, adds **Sans**, **Thanos**, and **Pea Shooter**, with more on the way. The mod is centered around adding new pop culture-themed units from various series, from movies to video games.

### If you have trouble with the mod, or if you just want to chat, you can join the [TABS Mod Center](https://discord.gg/zrs44qyp7S).

### This mod is [**open source**](https://github.com/donkeyrat/PopCulture).

## How To Use

Check your More Factions tab on the placement menu, and the mod's new faction will be there. Enjoy! There is also a new map, Judgement Hall.

## Units

| Unit | Description |
|-|-|
| **Pea Shooter** | A plant that fires peas at enemies. After a while, it can transform its mouth into a Gatling gun, and fire peas far more rapidly. |
| ***SANS*** | Good luck catching this slippery skeleton, for he's not here to crack jokes, but rather crack necks. From below he can summon waves of bones, or simply fire bones to pierce through units. His gaster blaster also brings chaos. |
| ***THANOS*** | Wielder of all six infinity stones, Thanos wields unstoppable power. He can turn his enemies into bats, or make them lose their minds, or freeze them in time, or even summon meteors. And at the start of all battles, he snaps. |
